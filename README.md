## Video Management System
### Description
This is a project that I have been doing during past internship (in C#, XAML) <br/>
VMS applied CCTV video information to big data platforms and artificial intelligence algorithms within the solution to detect video events.</br> It has improved accuracy, and blockchain technology, a distributed encryption technology, is used to prevent forgery and leakage of personal information in video information.</br> It's the first intelligent VMS in Korea<br/>
