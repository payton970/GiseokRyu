## Video Management System
#### Description
This is a project that I have been doing during past internship (in C#, XAML)
<br/>It is a VMS where you can stream more than 100 cameras at the same time
<br/>Also, by using GIS, it is available to see where the camera is located by just clicking the map
<br/>Furthermore, if the camera type is PTZ camera, you can control the direction of the camera from this program!
