This is a project that I have been doing during past internship (in C#, XAML) <br/>
VMS applied CCTV video information to big data platforms and artificial intelligence algorithms within the solution to detect video events.</br> It has improved accuracy, and blockchain technology, a distributed encryption technology, is used to prevent forgery and leakage of personal information in video information.</br> It's the first intelligent VMS in Korea<br/>

## 📝 Algorithms
#### Making Maximum Profits
Given some fixed maximum amount of money to spend, the market values of cards, and local card prices, 
how much money could you make by purchasing baseball cards from local card, and which cards should you buy?
