This is a project that I have been doing during past internship (in C#, XAML) <br/>
VMS applied CCTV video information to big data platforms and artificial intelligence algorithms within the solution to detect video events.</br> It has improved accuracy, and blockchain technology, a distributed encryption technology, is used to prevent forgery and leakage of personal information in video information.</br> It's the first intelligent VMS in Korea<br/>

As I became the representative of the department, I was able to learn responsibility and leadership for my new role, and I was able to experience various human relationships as I had more contact with seniors and juniors, including school professors. Additionally, with Undergraduate & Graduate Program Director professors and Engineering Advisor, I introduced the advantages and special reasons for our school's computer science to many people.
