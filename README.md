This is a project that I have been doing during past internship (in C#, XAML) <br/>
VMS applied CCTV video information to big data platforms and artificial intelligence algorithms within the solution to detect video events.</br> It has improved accuracy, and blockchain technology, a distributed encryption technology, is used to prevent forgery and leakage of personal information in video information.</br> It's the first intelligent VMS in Korea<br/>

As I became the representative of the department, I was able to learn responsibility and leadership for my new role, and I was able to experience various human relationships as I had more contact with seniors and juniors, including school professors. Additionally, with Undergraduate & Graduate Program Director professors and Engineering Advisor, I introduced the advantages and special reasons for our school's computer science to many people. 

## Research Paper
#### BDS IS THE MOST USEFUL METHOD FOR GPS
The Taylor method and BeiDou Navigation Satellite System method (BDS) are the common methods which are applied to GPS systems. However, the BDS method will provide a more precise location to the user than the Taylor method. I described how do these two methods work and compared them to prove that the BDS method far surpasses the Taylor Method.

## Algorithms
#### Making Maximum Profits
Given some fixed maximum amount of money to spend, the market values of cards, and local card prices, 
how much money could you make by purchasing baseball cards from local card, and which cards should you buy?

#### Finding the Winner of TV Show
Reality TV Game Shows such as Survivor, American Idol, Master Chef, and more, are often structured similarly to one another: contestants compete weekly, and after each competition, one or more contestants are eliminated from the show until a single contestant remains and is crowned the winner. This implemented a data structure that can be used to simulate the progress of an elimination game. In particular, this implemented an extended min-heap to implement a priority queue.
